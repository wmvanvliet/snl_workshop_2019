If you had to specify them all every time you want to call a function, you'd spend ages worrying about little details and get nothing done. Luckily, Python allows us to specify default values for parameters, which means these parameter may be omitted when calling a function to use the default. In MNE-Python, most parameters have a default value, so while a function may have 20 parameters, you only have to specify one or two. The rest of the parameters are like little knobs and buttons you can use to fine tune things, or just leave alone. This allows MNE-Python to keep simple things simple, while making complicated things possible.\n",

It controls whether to load all of the data in memory, or only read the \"metadata\" of the file, i.e., when it was recorded, how long it is, how many sensors the MEG machine had, etc. By default, `preload=False`, meaning only the metadata is read.
